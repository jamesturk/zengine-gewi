A Note From James:
    For an explanation of the licensing simply refer to the files that come with 
ZEngine, Gewi is unusable without ZEngine so it is safe to assume you have it 
already.  If for any reason you have Gewi but not ZEngine you may obtain ZEngine
here: http://zengine.sourceforge.net/.
